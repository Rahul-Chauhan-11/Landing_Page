            <h2>WHAT IS ANIME?</h2>
            <p>
                Anime (Japanese: アニメ, IPA: [aꜜɲime] ⓘ) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.
                
                However, in Japan and Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word “animation”) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. 
                
                Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. 

                The term "anime"is used to describe all types of Japanese animation, regardless of their origin (national or foreign). 
                
                However, the exact origin of the word "anime" remains uncertain. Some researchers believe it's an abbreviation of the English word "animation", while others suggest it might have come from the French word "animée", meaning "animated".

            <h3>CHARACTERISTICS OF ANIME</h3>
            <p>
                <p>Anime covers a wide range of genres, catering to various tastes. 
                From action and adventure to romance, horror, science fiction, and slice-of-life, there's something for everyone.
                Genres can blend seamlessly within a single anime, creating unique and engaging narratives.</p>

                Anime characters often convey their emotions through exaggerated facial expressions. The large, expressive eyes play a significant role in this.
                Whether it's joy, surprise, anger, or sadness, anime characters wear their feelings on their faces.

                The iconic “anime eyes” are characterized by vibrant colors (such as blue, green, or purple) and a distinct shine.
                These eyes symbolize intensity, innocence, and depth of emotion.

                <p>Anime uses onomatopoeic words (like “bang,” “whoosh,” or “thud”) to emphasize actions, impacts, or feelings.
                These sound effects enhance the visual storytelling.

                Each anime series has its own art style, ranging from realistic to highly stylized.
                The diversity of styles allows creators to evoke specific moods and atmospheres.</p>

                Anime excels in depicting fast-paced action, whether it's epic battles, martial arts, or supernatural abilities.
                Fluid animation and creative camera angles make action sequences visually captivating.
                Anime is a visual medium that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of age or experience.
